/**
 * The record batch structure is common to both the produce and fetch requests.
 *
 * A record batch is just a sequence of records with offset and size information.
 *
 * RecordBatch implementation for magic 2 and above. The schema is given below:
 *
 * RecordBatch =>
 *   BaseOffset => Int64
 *   Length => Int32
 *   PartitionLeaderEpoch => Int32
 *   Magic => Int8
 *   CRC => Uint32
 *   Attributes => Int16
 *   LastOffsetDelta => Int32 // also serves as LastSequenceDelta
 *   FirstTimestamp => Int64
 *   MaxTimestamp => Int64
 *   ProducerId => Int64
 *   ProducerEpoch => Int16
 *   BaseSequence => Int32
 *   Records => [Record]
 *
 * Note that when compression is enabled (see attributes below), the compressed record data is serialized
 * directly following the count of the number of records.
 *
 * The CRC covers the data from the attributes to the end of the batch (i.e. all the bytes that follow the CRC). It is
 * located after the magic byte, which means that clients must parse the magic byte before deciding how to interpret
 * the bytes between the batch length and the magic byte. The partition leader epoch field is not included in the CRC
 * computation to avoid the need to recompute the CRC when this field is assigned for every batch that is received by
 * the broker. The CRC-32C (Castagnoli) polynomial is used for the computation.
 *
 * On Compaction: Unlike the older message formats, magic v2 and above preserves the first and last offset/sequence
 * numbers from the original batch when the log is cleaned. This is required in order to be able to restore the
 * producer's state when the log is reloaded. If we did not retain the last sequence number, then following
 * a partition leader failure, once the new leader has rebuilt the producer state from the log, the next sequence
 * expected number would no longer be in sync with what was written by the client. This would cause an
 * unexpected OutOfOrderSequence error, which is typically fatal. The base sequence number must be preserved for
 * duplicate checking: the broker checks incoming Produce requests for duplicates by verifying that the first and
 * last sequence numbers of the incoming batch match the last from that producer.
 *
 * Note that if all of the records in a batch are removed during compaction, the broker may still retain an empty
 * batch header in order to preserve the producer sequence information as described above. These empty batches
 * are retained only until either a new sequence number is written by the corresponding producer or the producerId
 * is expired from lack of activity.
 *
 * There is no similar need to preserve the timestamp from the original batch after compaction. The FirstTimestamp
 * field therefore always reflects the timestamp of the first record in the batch. If the batch is empty, the
 * FirstTimestamp will be set to -1 (NO_TIMESTAMP).
 *
 * Similarly, the MaxTimestamp field reflects the maximum timestamp of the current records if the timestamp type
 * is CREATE_TIME. For LOG_APPEND_TIME, on the other hand, the MaxTimestamp field reflects the timestamp set
 * by the broker and is preserved after compaction. Additionally, the MaxTimestamp of an empty batch always retains
 * the previous value prior to becoming empty.
 *
 * The current attributes are given below:
 *
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  | Unused (6-15) | Control (5) | Transactional (4) | Timestamp Type (3) | Compression Type (0-2) |
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
