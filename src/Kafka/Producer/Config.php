     * The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request

     *
     * acks=0 If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record
     * will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has
     * received the record in this case, and the retries configuration will not take effect (as the client won't
     * generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.
     *
     * acks=1 This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full
     * acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the
     * record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.
     *
     * acks=all This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This
     * guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the
     * strongest available guarantee.
