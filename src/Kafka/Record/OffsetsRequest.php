/**
 * Offsets API
 *
 * This API describes the valid offset range available for a set of topic-partitions. As with the produce and fetch
 * APIs requests must be directed to the broker that is currently the leader for the partitions in question. This can
 * be determined using the metadata API.
 *
 * The response contains the starting offset of each segment for the requested partition as well as the "log end
 * offset" i.e. the offset of the next message that would be appended to the given partition.
 *
 * ListOffsets Request (Version: 1) => replica_id [topics]
 *   replica_id => INT32
 *   topics => topic [partitions]
 *     topic => STRING
 *     partitions => partition timestamp
 *       partition => INT32
 *       timestamp => INT64
