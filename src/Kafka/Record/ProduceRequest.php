/**
 * The produce API
 *
 * The produce API is used to send message sets to the server. For efficiency it allows sending message sets intended
 * for many topic partitions in a single request.
 *
 * The produce API uses the generic message set format, but since no offset has been assigned to the messages at the
 * time of the send the producer is free to fill in that field in any way it likes.
