/**
 * Fetch API
 *
 * The fetch API is used to fetch a chunk of one or more logs for some topic-partitions. Logically one specifies the
 * topics, partitions, and starting offset at which to begin the fetch and gets back a chunk of messages. In general,
 * the return messages will have offsets larger than or equal to the starting offset. However, with compressed
 * messages, it's possible for the returned messages to have offsets smaller than the starting offset. The number of
 * such messages is typically small and the caller is responsible for filtering out those messages.
 *
 * Fetch requests follow a long poll model so they can be made to block for a period of time if sufficient data is not
 * immediately available.
 *
 * As an optimization the server is allowed to return a partial message at the end of the message set. Clients should
 * handle this case.
 *
 * One thing to note is that the fetch API requires specifying the partition to consume from. The question is how
 * should a consumer know what partitions to consume from? In particular how can you balance the partitions over a set
 * of consumers acting as a group so that each consumer gets a subset of partitions. We have done this assignment
 * dynamically using zookeeper for the scala and java client. The downside of this approach is that it requires a
 * fairly fat client and a zookeeper connection. We haven't yet created a Kafka API to allow this functionality to be
 * moved to the server side and accessed more conveniently. A simple consumer client can be implemented by simply
 * requiring that the partitions be specified in config, though this will not allow dynamic reassignment of partitions
 * should that consumer fail. We hope to address this gap in the next major release.
